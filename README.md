Teamtreehouse - Project 3<br />
Interactive Form

Hello Internet.

I built this [web form](https://ragatep.github.io/Interactive_Form/) with added interactivity and enhancements on useability using Javascript. This build is for a project from Teamtreehouse's Techdegree Full Stack Javascript Unit 3. 

I have used the concepts and techniques listed in the project instructions and used a few sample codes from topics covered throughout Unit 3 and the Project Resources. I've also used other resources found on the web and cited my sources in the script.js file.
